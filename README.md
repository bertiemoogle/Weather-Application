# Weather-Application

I coded the majority of the app without using any Google resources, so there is probably more code than there needs to be. I'm hoping I can improve this aspect of my programming in time when I have more time to actually study refactoring code. The process was fairly straightforward - understanding the returned search objects is very logical. Although getting the search function to work took some time. 

All the information printed to the page is contained in the objects returned by the API request, including the code for the weather icons, which is where I'm a bit stuck at the moment. A new search replaces the temperature, wind speed and humidity information with no problems. But the weather icons aren't replaced - a new one is just appended to the page next to the previous one. I am going to continue working on this, but submission time is fast approaching.
